== Drivers ==

"In computing, a device driver is a computer program that operates or controls a particular type of device that is attached to a computer or automaton.[1] A driver provides a software interface to hardware devices, enabling operating systems and other computer programs to access hardware functions without needing to know precise details about the hardware being used."
